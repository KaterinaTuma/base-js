### Task

Implement function `check(str, bracketsConfig)`, that for given brackets sequence will return `true` if it is correct and `false` otherwise

In the second param there is `bracketsConfig` - the array of pairs open-closed brackets. Each subarray includes only 2 elements - opening and closing bracket

### Example

```js
"(){}[]"   =>  True
"([{}])"   =>  True
"(}"       =>  False
"[(])"     =>  False
"[({})](]" =>  False
```
